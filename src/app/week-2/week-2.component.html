            The second week of our OJT was marked by both excitement and frustration as we changed our focus from planning to the implementation phase. Our goal was to begin developing the system using the tools and technologies we had previously selected: Flutter for the user interface and Angular for the admin management side. We relied on our Figma prototype, Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), user stories, and database structure to guide our development process. However, we quickly encountered significant challenges.

          <p class="my-6 poppins-light text-sm">
            One of the primary difficulties we faced was our limited familiarity with the technologies we were using. Flutter, which is designed for cross-platform mobile development, was entirely new to our team, and Angular, a robust frontend framework for web applications, was equally unfamiliar. This lack of experience led to a slow learning progress, making it difficult to transform our planned designs into functional components.To ensure progress despite these obstacles, I took the initiative to divide the tasks among our team members:

                Our development process was slow and often frustrating. Since we were learning these technologies as we worked, we spent a considerable amount of time reading documentation, watching tutorials, and experimenting with code. Progress was gradual, and our initial excitement was overshadowed by the difficulties of learning two complex frameworks simultaneously. Despite the setbacks, we remained determined, constantly sharing knowledge together.

                Before the week ends, we prepared for our first presentation for February 14. Our objective was to present our progress to Ma’am Maxell, the head of the company. We showcased our system’s flowchart, explaining the user flow, data management, and the overall functionality of our application. We hope to get positive feedback however, the presentation did not go as planned. The flowchart, which we had designed to be simple and easy to understand, was performed for being too basic. Ma’am Maxell expected a more complex system design, with raw data management, transaction tracking, and user activity logs. Although we attempted to defend our design, explaining that our focus was on simplicity, our explanation was not accepted. The result was a complete rejection of our system. We were presented with a choice: either develop a basic school inventory system or shift to a new project called "NearbyTask." This unexpected turn of events left us feeling disheartened. Our hard work from the past two weeks felt wasted, and as the Team Leader, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of failure and not guiding my team more effectively.

                This week was a difficult experience for my team. However, it also taught us the importance of flexibility, active communication, and aligning our efforts with the expectations of our supervisor or seniors. It became clear that being a team leader was not just about planning and task assignment but also about effectively managing challenges and adapting to feedback.
